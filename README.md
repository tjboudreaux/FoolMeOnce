### Fool Me Once ###
Fool Me Once is a Chrome browser extension that is useful for identifying satirical news sites. If you've ever been suckered into sharing a satirical article because you thought it was true, this is the plugin for you.  A small icon will appear in the address bar when a satirical news site is detected. If you see the icon, you can prevent yourself from being fooled again.

### Building the plugin ###

 - Run `npm install` to install the gulp dependencies
 - Run `gulp` to build the plugin for distribution

### Contributing ###
If there's a site that is a satirical or faux news site that is not detected by the plugin, fork the repository, add the site to `src/bg/background.js` and open a pull request.
